Details

Data on 180 economic journals, collected in particular for analyzing journal pricing. See also http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Journals/jpricing.html for general information on this topic as well as a more up-to-date version of the data set. This version is taken from Stock and Watson (2007).

The data as obtained from the online complements for Stock and Watson (2007) contained two journals with title “World Development”. One of these (observation 80) seemed to be an error and was changed to “The World Economy”.
